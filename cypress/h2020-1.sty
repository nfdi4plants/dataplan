1    Introduction
To best profit from open data, it is necessary not only to store the data but to make it Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). 
The aim of this document is to provide guidelines on the principles of data management in Example Project. A Data Management Plan (DMP) will be generated by using the responses to the EU questionnaire on DMP, which defines the data stored in Example Project. 
The detailed DMP states how data will be handled during and after the project. The Example Project DMP is prepared according to the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe online manual.

2.1    Data Summary
What is the purpose of the data collection/generation and its relation to the objectives of the project?
Example Project aims at Example Aim. Therefore, data collection and integration using the DataPLANT Annotated Research Context (ARC) structure are absolutely necessary, because the data are used not only to understand principles, but also be informed about the provenance of data analysis information. Stakeholders must also be informed about the provenance of data. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the data are well generated and also well annotated with metadata using open standards, as laid out in the next section. 
What types and formats of data will the project generate/collect?
Example Project will collect and/or generate the following types of raw data: and other types of data which are related to Example Topic. In addition, the raw data will also be processed and modified using analytical pipelines, which may yield different results or include ad hoc data analysis parts. These pipelines will be tracked in the DataPLANT ARC. Therefore, care will be taken to document and archive these resources (including the analytical pipelines) as well, relying on the expertise in the DataPLANT consortium. 
Will you re-use any existing data and how?
The project builds on existing data sets. For data of Example Topic, existing data sets as well as additional characterizations and background knowledge on the topic will be used from prior publications. Genomic references can simply be gathered from reference databases for genomes/sequences, like the National Center for Biotechnology Information: NCBI (US); European Bioinformatics Institute: EBI (EU); DNA Data Bank of Japan: DDBJ (JP). 
What is the origin of the data?
Public data will be extracted as described in the previous paragraph. For Example Project, specific data sets will be generated by the consortium partners.
Data of different types or representing different domains will be generated using unique approaches. For example: 
    
What is the expected size of the data?
We expect to generate ??? GB of raw data and up to ??? GB of processed data.
To whom might it be useful ('data utility')?
The data will initially benefit Example Project partners, but will also be made available to selected stakeholders closely involved in the project, and then the scientific community working on Example Topic. Industry, politicians and students can also use the data for different purposes. In addition, the general public interested in Example Topic can also use the data after publication. The data will be disseminated according to Example Project's dissemination and communication plan, which aligns with DataPLANT platform or other means. 
2.2    FAIR data
Making data findable, including provisions for metadata
Are the data produced and/or used in the project discoverable with metadata, identifiable and locatable by means of a standard identification mechanism (e.g. persistent and unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers)? 
All datasets will be associated with unique identifiers and will be annotated with metadata. We will use Investigation, Study, Assay (ISA) specification for metadata creation. Example Project will rely on community standards plus additional recommendations applicable in the plant science, such as the The following metadata/ minimum information standards will be used to collect metadata:. These specific standard unlike cross-domain minimal sets such as the Dublin core, which mostly define the submitter and the general type of data, allow reusability by other researchers by defining properties of the plant (see the preceding section). However, Example Project also implement minimal cross-domain annotations. The core integration with DataPLANT will also allow individual releases to be tagged with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). 
What naming conventions do you follow?
Data variables will be allocated standard names. For example, genes, proteins and metabolites will be named according to approved nomenclature and conventions. These will also be linked to functional ontologies where possible. Datasets will also be named in a meaningful way to ensure readability by humans. Plant names will include traditional names, binomials, and all strain/cultivar/subspecies/variety identifiers. 
Will search keywords be provided that optimize possibilities for re-use?
Keywords about the experiment and consortium will be included, as well as an abstract about the data, where useful. In addition, certain keywords can be auto-generated from dense metadata and its underlying ontologies. Here, DataPLANT strives to complement these with standardized DataPLANT ontologies that are provided where the ontology does not yet include such variables. 
Do you provide clear version numbers?
To maintain data integrity and facilitate reanalysis, data sets will be allocated version numbers where this is useful (e.g. raw data must not be changed and will not get a version number and is considered immutable). This is automatically supported by the ARC Git DataPLANT infrastructure. 
What metadata will be created? In case metadata standards do not exist in your discipline, please outline what type of metadata will be created and how. 
We will use Investigation, Study and Assay (ISA) specification for metadata creation. The following metadata standards will also be used:. 
Making data openly accessible
Which data produced and/or used in the project will be made openly available as the default? If certain datasets cannot be shared (or need to be shared under restrictions), we explain why, clearly separating legal and contractual reasons from voluntary restrictions. 
By default, all data sets from Example Project will be shared with the community and made openly available. However, before the data are released, all will be provided with an opportunity to check for potential IP (according to the consortium agreement and background IP rights). IP protection will be prioritized for datasets that offer the potential for exploitation. 
Note that in multi-beneficiary projects it is also possible for specific beneficiaries to keep their data closed if relevant provisions are made in the consortium agreement and are in line with the reasons for opting out. 
How will the data be made accessible (e.g. by deposition in a repository)?
Data will be made available via the Example Project platform using a user-friendly front end that allows data visualization. Besides this it will be ensured that data which can be stored in international discipline related repositories which use specialized technologies: 


For unstructured and less standardized data (e.g., experimental phenotypic measurements), these will be annotated with metadata and if complete allocated a digital object identifier (DOI). Whole datasets will also be wrapped into an ARC with allocated DOIs. The ARC and the converters provided by DataPLANT will ensure that the upload into the endpoint repositories is fast and easy. 
What methods or software tools are needed to access the data?
No specialized software will be needed to access the data, just a modern browser. Access will be possible through web interfaces. For data processing after obtaining raw data, typical open-source software can be used. 
DataPLANT offers opensource data curation tools such as the ARC management tool ARCitect, command line tool ARCcommander, DataPLANT Biological Ontology (DPBO), metadata annotation tool swate, the Metadata Quiz and DataPLAN DMP generator. 
Is documentation about the software needed to access the data included?
DataPLANT resources are well described, and their setup is documented on a github project guide is provided on the GitHub project pages. All external software documentation will be duplicated locally and stored near the software. 
Is it possible to include the relevant software (e.g. in open-source code)?
As stated above, Example Project will use publicly available open-source and well-documented certified software.
Where will the data and associated metadata, documentation and code be deposited? Preference should be given to certified repositories that support open access, where possible. 
As noted above, specialized repositories will be used for common data types. For unstructured and less standardized data (e.g., experimental phenotypic measurements), these will be annotated with metadata and if complete allocated a digital object identifier (DOI). The Whole datasets will also be wrapped into an ARC with allocated DOIs. 
Have you explored appropriate arrangements with the identified repository?
The submission is for free, and it is the goal (at least of ENA) to obtain as much data as possible. Therefore, arrangements are neither necessary nor useful. Catch-all repositories are not required, and this has been confirmed for data associated with DataPLANT. <-- Please pay attention to the sentence before. If no data management platform such as DataPLANT is used, then you need to find appropriate repository to store or archive your data after publication. 
If there are restrictions on use, how will access be provided?
There are no restrictions beyond the IP screening described above, which is in line with European open data policies.
Is there a need for a data access committee?
There is no need for a data access committee.
Are there well described conditions for access (i.e. a machine-readable license)?
Yes, where possible, e.g. CC REL will be used for data not submitted to specialized repositories such as ENA.
How will the identity of the person accessing the data be ascertained? 
When data are shared only within the consortium, if the datasets are not yet complete or are undergoing IP checks, the data will be hosted internally, requiring a username and password for access (see GDPR rules). Once the data are made public in EU or US repositories, completely anonymous access is typically allowed. This applies to ENA as well, and both are in line with GDPR requirements. 
Currently, data management relies on the annotated research context (ARC). It is password protected, so before any data or samples can be obtained, user authentication is required. 
Making data interoperable
Are the data produced in the project interoperable, that is allowing data exchange and re-use between researchers, institutions, organizations, countries, etc. (i.e. adhering to standards for formats, as much as possible compliant with available (open) software applications, and in particular facilitating re-combinations with different datasets from different origins)? 
Whenever possible, data will be stored in common and openly defined formats including all the necessary metadata to interpret and analyze data in a biological context. By default, no proprietary formats will be used. However, Microsoft Excel files (according to ISO/IEC 29500-1:2016) might be used as intermediates by the consortium and by some ARC components. In addition, text files might be edited in text processor files, but will be shared as pdf. 
What data and metadata vocabularies, standards or methodologies will you follow to make your data interoperable?
We will use Investigation, Study and Assay (ISA) specification for metadata creation. The following metadata standards will also be used:. 
The minimal information standards will allow the integration of data across projects, and its reuse according to established and tested protocols. We will also use ontological terms to enrich the data sets relying on free and open ontologies where possible. Additional ontology terms might be created and canonized during Example Project. 
Will you be using standard vocabularies for all data types present in your data set, to allow inter-disciplinary interoperability?
Open ontologies will be used where they are mature. As stated above, some ontologies and controlled vocabularies might need to be extended. Here, Example Project will build on the advanced ontologies integrated in DataPLANT. 
In case it is unavoidable that you use uncommon or generate project specific ontologies or vocabularies, will you provide mappings to more commonly used ontologies?
Common and open ontologies will be used, so this question does not apply.
Increase data reuse (by clarifying licences) 
How will the data be licensed to permit the widest re-use possible? 
Open licenses, such as Creative Commons (CC), will be used whenever possible.
When will the data be made available for re-use? If an embargo is sought to give time to publish or seek patents, specify why and how long this will apply, bearing in mind that research data should be made available as soon as possible. 
All consortium partners will be encouraged to make data available before publication, openly and/or under pre-publication agreements. This will be implemented as soon as IP-related checks are complete. 
Are the data produced and/or used in the project usable by third parties, in particular after the end of the project? If the re-use of some data is restricted, explain why.
There will be no restrictions once the data are made public.
How long is it intended that the data remains re-usable?
The data will be made available for many years and ideally indefinitely after the end of the project.
Data submitted to repositories (as detailed above) would be subject to local data storage regulation. 
Are data quality assurance processes described?
The data will be checked and curated. Furthermore, data will be quality controlled (QC) using automatic procedures as well as manual curation. 
2.3    Allocation of resources
What are the costs for making data FAIR in your project?
Example Project will bear the costs of data curation, ARC consistency checks, and data maintenance/security before transfer to public repositories. Subsequent costs are then borne by the operators of these repositories.
Additionally, costs for after publication storage are incurred by end-point repositories as detailed in section 2.4 but not charged against Example Project or its members but by the operation budget of these repositories. 
How will these be covered? Note that costs related to open access to research data are eligible as part of the Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe grant (if compliant with the Grant Agreement conditions). 
The cost born by Example Project are covered by the project funding. Pre-existing structures such as structures, tools, and knowledge laid down in the DataPLANT consortium will also be used.
Who will be responsible for data management in your project?
The responsible person will be Example data officer name of Example Project.
Are the resources for long term preservation discussed (costs and potential value, who decides and how/what data will be kept and for how long)?
The data officer will ultimately decide on the strategy to preserve data that are not submitted to end-point subject area repositories or ARCs in DataPLANT when the project ends. This will be in line with EU guidlines, institute policies, and data sharing based on EU and international standards. 
2.4    Data security
What provisions are in place for data security (including data recovery as well as secure storage and transfer of sensitive data)?
Online platforms will be protected by vulnerability scanning, two-factor authorization and daily automatic backups allowing immediate recovery. All partners holding confidential project data will use secure platforms with automatic backups and offsite secure copies. As ARCs are stored in the PlantDataHub of DataPLANT, data security will be imposed. This comprises secure storage, and the use of password and usernames is generally transferred via separate safe media. 
Is the data safely stored in certified repositories for long term preservation and curation?
As mentioned above and data will be made archived in international discipline related repositories which use specialized technologies:. 
2.5    Ethical aspects
Are there any ethical or legal issues that can have an impact on data sharing? These can also be discussed in the context of an ethics review. If relevant, include references to ethics deliverables and ethics chapter in the Description of the Action (DoA). 
At the moment, we do not anticipate ethical or legal issues with data sharing. In terms of ethics, since this is plant data, there is no need for an ethics committee to deal with data from plants, although we will diligently follow the Nagoya protocol on access and benefit sharing. <-- Please pay attention to the sentence before. Please ensure that you complete any necessary due diligence. Currently, we are awaiting clarification on whether the Nagoya Protocol (🡺 see Nagoya Protocol) will encompass sequence information. Regardless, if you use material from a country other than your own (or that of your partner), and you conduct physical or biochemical characterization (e.g., metabolites, proteome, RNASeq, etc.), this may constitute an action relevant under the Nagoya Protocol. Exceptions might include materials from countries such as the U.S. (non-partner), Ireland (has not signed—still contact them), etc., though other laws could apply. 
Is informed consent for data sharing and long term preservation included in questionnaires dealing with personal data?
The only personal data that will potentially be stored is the submitter name and affiliation in the metadata for data. In addition, personal data will be collected for dissemination and communication activities using specific methods and procedures developed by Example Project partners to adhere to data protection. <-- Please pay attention to the sentence before. You need to inform and better get WRITTEN consent that you store emails and names or even pseudonyms such as twitter handles, we are very sorry about these issues we didn’t invent them 
2.6    Other issues
Do you make use of other national/funder/sectorial/departmental procedures for data management? If yes, which ones?
Yes, Example Project will use common Research Data Management (RDM) infrastructures developed by the NFDI of Germany.
